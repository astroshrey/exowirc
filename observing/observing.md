# Guidelines for observing exoplanets with Palomar/WIRC

Here's how you observe your favorite transiting exoplanet with Palomar/WIRC.

### Calibrations

Take most of your calibrations at the start of the night, to save yourself the pain of forgetting calibrations at the end of the night.

1. Take darks for your flats first. Ensure the mirror cover is on and the dome is dark. Then, take a series of 2 s (for J and He band), 1 s (for H band), or 0.92 s (for Ks band) darks. We typically take 1 test dark to make sure everything looks OK, and then we take 20 more.

2. Take dome flats. Ask the TO to take the mirror cover off and turn the low lamp (for J/H/Ks) or the "super high lamp" (for He band). For Ks band, you will need to cover the mirror by about 50% (maybe more) to avoid substantial nonlinearity. Once things are set up, take 1 test flat, ensure things are not nonlinear (< 30K counts), and then take 20 more.

3. If you know the exposure time of your target already (maybe because you've already observed it), go ahead and take darks for your target now. Same as before -- ensure the mirror cover is on and the dome is dark, take 1 test dark to make sure things look OK, and take at least 10-20 more. 


### Getting on sky

Now that your calibrations are done, you're ready to get on sky!

1. Ask the TO to open the dome and go to a 11th-12th mag SAO star to check pointing and focusing. If you're worried about pointing you may want to ask for a brighter SAO star, but it's usually fine.

2. While the dome opens and the telescope slews to your target, change the filter wheel to Open/J, where it will be easiest to see the field and focus.
